# This is REACTJS Side Hustle Internship 6.0 (Alpha Clan project to build a food application with the following features: 

         Create a new project using npx create-react-app food-app. 

         You should use functional components for this project. 

         Think about how to structure your application into components.

## Create a page folder in your src directory and add your pages. Your application should have:
         A Landing page that links to the sign up and login pages.
         A Register/Sign up page
         A Login page
         A Dashboard page.
         Create a components folder in your src directory and add your components.
## Implement the three modals:
         Cart modal
         Order modal
         Checkout modal
### N.B: this isn’t compulsory but nice to have.

Don’t forget to push your solution to GitHub and deploy. (You should be proud of your work and show it off to the world!)
